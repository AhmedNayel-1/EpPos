## What is this magic?
EpPOS is a web-based platform-independant sales program, currently tailored towards pubs and restaurants. You can host it yourself, use it on any device with any screen size you could possibly imagine (although an iPod Classic might be tricky).

## Why would I want this?
Well, this thing is seriously easy, and you don't have to trust another company with your data. You can open the page on mobile client, walk towards your clients, and take their order. When you come back to the bar, you log in on a bigger screen and work your way throught the order. Simple. Fast. Elegant. And, most importantly, free and open source. (Apache License)

## I don't quite feel confident setting that up myself, after all, I am a manager.
No problem, send any of the contributors of this project a message or email and we'll try to help you.
My email is stef [dot] plet @ gmail [dotcom] and I am sometimes called Stef Pletinck
