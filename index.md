EpPOS is a web-based platform-independant sales program, with a slight bias towards small businesses like food trucks. You can host it yourself and use it on any device with any screen size you could possibly imagine (although an iPod Classic might be tricky).

## Why would you want this?
Well, this thing is seriously easy, and you don't have to trust another company with your data. 

You can open the page on mobile client, walk towards your clients, and take their order. When you come back to the bar, you log in on a bigger screen and work your way throught the order. Simple. Fast. Elegant. And, most importantly, free and open source. (Apache License)

## Don't feel confident setting this up yourself?
No problem, send any of the contributors of this project a message or email and we'll try to help you.
My email is s[at]stefpletinck[dot]be and I am sometimes called Stef Pletinck.
